ML code tests
Let's write a test case that will check if our Random Forest algorithm is working as expected. For testing,
I will use one row from train data and check if the prediction is correct.

Please add two files into ml directory: empty __init__.py file and tests.py file with the following code:

The above test is:

constructing an input JSON data object,
initializing ML algorithm,
computing ML prediction and checking the prediction outcome.


To run Django tests run the following command:
# please run in backend/server directory
python manage.py test apps.ml.tests
You should see that 1 test was run.
